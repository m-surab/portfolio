From a young age, I have been deeply fascinated by technology, gadgets, and computers. One of my favorite activities as a child was disassembling devices and reassembling them, reveling in the process of understanding how things worked. This curiosity and passion for technology naturally led me to pursue a career in IT.

After graduating from high school with a focus on information technology and networking, I began my studies at the Technical University of Ostrava in the field of Information and Communication Technology. I completed a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology. During my master’s program, I specialized in Computer Graphics and Image Processing. However, as I started working part-time during my studies, I discovered a different career direction that aligned more closely with my aspirations. This led me to make the decision to transition to full-time work and focus entirely on building my career in the IT industry.

I am deeply passionate about learning new skills and improving my knowledge. When I consider something important, I dedicate myself fully, often spending countless hours honing my expertise.

One of my greatest strengths is my sense of responsibility. As the first-born child, I naturally assumed responsibility in various situations, which shaped me into a reliable and somewhat perfectionist individual. I approach challenges with logic and reason, always striving to find practical solutions. On the other hand, I am still trying to be empathetic and willing to help others whenever I can contribute meaningfully.

Above all, I value purpose and clarity in everything I do. I am driven by the bigger picture and seek to understand the consequences of my actions. Give me a meaningful reason and a good vision, and I’ll give it my best effort.
